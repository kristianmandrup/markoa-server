# Routes

## RouteBuilder

`route-builder` has `buildRoute` method to build a route on the koa application.

## RouteConfig

`route-config` has a `buildAll` method to build all the routes from the list of active pages on the `config` object.

## TODO

Consider using a real Router:

* [koa-routing](https://github.com/ivpusic/koa-routing)
* [koa-router](https://github.com/alexmingoia/koa-router)
